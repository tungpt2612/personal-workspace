### Data Strategy
- 6 Stages of Data (Doesn't need to be linear or in order, could be loop at any Stage)
    - Capture
    - Store
    - Process
    - Share
    - Use
    - EOL
- 5 Objects of Data Stragtegy
    - People
    - Process
    - Technology
    - Data
    - Organization
- 4 Types of Analytic
    - Descriptive (Historical Statistic Report)
    - Diagnostic (Investigate Reason Behind above number)
    - Predictive (Forecast number based on number above)
    - Prescriptive (Making Decision based on above output)
- Data Strategy involved with all Aspects that listed above. So how to approach and define reasonable Data Strategy
    1. Assess 5 Objects of Data Strategy, current state $${\color{red}\-----> Next actions is to create questionnaire to assess{ALERT!}}$$.
    2. Using the Organization Assessment with Organization Objectives to identify kind of Key Metric / Measureable Metric that Organization want to achieve<span style="color: red;">-----> List down all the Key Metric and Measureable Metric</span>. 
    3. Align the Key Metric and Measureable with Analytical Types that could help (Identify Use Case) <span style="color: red;">-----> Next actions is Researching for Publish Material that supported any metric/number of how analytical could help and align with the Organization Objectives</span>.
    4. Gap Analysis <span style="color: red;">-----> Next actions is walk through all 5 of the Objects and 6 Stages of Data to identify what is missing from ideal architecture that prevent organization to achieve to target </span>
    5. Deliver Data Strategy <span style="color: red;">-----> Next actions is define Data Strategy Initiatives that could close as many gaps as possible</span>
