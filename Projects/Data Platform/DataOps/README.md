### Data Strategy
- 6 Stages of Data (Doesn't need to be linear or in order, could be loop at any Stage)
    - Capture
    - Store
    - Process
    - Share
    - Use
    - EOL
- 5 Objects of Data Stragtegy
    - People
    - Process
    - Technology
    - Data
    - Organization
- 4 Types of Analytic
    - Descriptive (Historical Statistic Report)
    - Diagnostic (Investigate Reason Behind above number)
    - Predictive (Forecast number based on number above)
    - Prescriptive (Making Decision based on above output)
- Data Strategy involved with all Aspects that listed above. So how to approach and define reasonable Data Strategy
    1. **Assess 5 Objects of Data Strategy, current state ****
    ```javascript
    Next actions is to create questionnaire to assess.
    ```
    2. **Using the Organization Assessment with Organization Objectives to identify kind of Key Metric / Measureable Metric that Organization want to achieve**
    ```javascript
    List down all the Key Metric and Measureable Metric. 
    ```
    3. **Align the Key Metric and Measureable with Analytical Types that could help (Identify Use Case)**
    ```javascript
    Next actions is Researching for Publish Material that supported any metric/number of how analytical could help and align with the Organization Objectives
    ```
    4. **Gap Analysis**
    ```javascript
    Next actions is walk through all 5 of the Objects and 6 Stages of Data to identify what is missing from ideal architecture that prevent organization to achieve to target
    ```
    5. **Deliver Data Strategy**
    ```javascript
    Next actions is define Data Strategy Initiatives that could close as many gaps as possible
    ```
